## Goal

Hi everyone,

Our goal is to build a simple app, as discussed in class. Main features:

- Home page
    + Links to internal pages
    + Links to other resources
- Calendar
    + All school events
    + Classes (individual)
- Delays/school cancellation
- Contact info (structured, sortable)
    + Teacher emails
    + Student council members and emails
- City resources
    + Bus schedule
    + Public services contact info
- Community service hours tracker
    + Email with photos of community service forms

The easiest way to build this app is to build it as a mobile-optimized website.

On a website, pages are either **static** or **dynamic**. A static page, like
a list of links, does not change in response to user input. A dynmic page, like
a calendar or community service tracker, changes when the user interacts with it.

Here's our list of features, divided by static and dynamic:

### Static pages

- Home page
    + Links to internal pages
    + Links to other resources
- City resources
    + Bus schedule
    + Public services contact info
- Contact info 
    + Teacher emails
    + Student council members and emails

### Dynamic pages

- Calendar
    + All school events
    + Classes (individual)
- Community service hours tracker
    + Email with photos of community service forms

You might notice that the static pages are the easiest to build. Essentially
they are going to be a list of links. You know how to do this.

## Plan of attack

We want to complete the static pages before we complete the dynamic pages. This is because static pages are easier to code and will give us a good starting point.

So, we have three static pages we want to make. Let's break into teams.

### Team 1: home page and template (index.html)

Responsibilities:

- Links to internal pages
- Description of app 

### Team 2: city resources (city.html)

Responsibilities:

- Collect data on city resources (i.e., find links to include)
- Insert list of links to city resources

### Team 3: contact info (contact.html)

Responsibilities:

- Collect emails to include
- Insert links to email. Use `mailto:` links to open email programs

## Working on the code

This repository contains the three files you need to get started. Each team
should only work on one file, as described above.
